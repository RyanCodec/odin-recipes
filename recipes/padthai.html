    <h2>Delicious and nutritious meal that can be made vegan</h2>
    <p>Made with some simple ingredients, this meal is sure to impress and leave you with leftovers for lunch the next day.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Frozen Veggies</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Meat (I recommend PLantasia "Roast Duck" made from gluten protein.)</li>

        <li>Crushed Ginger, Garlic & Chilli</li>
        <li>Satay or Terriyaki sauce</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to pan</li>
        <li>Chop onion and throw into frying pan on medium heat</li>
        <li>Put approximately 500-750g of frozen veggies in the pan and put the lid on the pan.</li>
        <li>Put a pot of water enough to cover the noodles on to boil</li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon of crushed garlic, ginger and chilli, and mix it into the veggies</li>
        <li>Chop mushrooms into big chunks</li>
        <li>Stir the veggies and push them to one side of the pan, leaving the lid off if the veggies are defrosted</li>
        <li>Add Noodles to pot of water when it reaches boiling</li>
        <li>Add oil to the empty side of the pan and add mushrooms, dribbling a bit of oil on top of them and stirring the mushrooms, keeping them seperate for now</li>
        <li>Stir veggies and add oil to any dry spots under them</li>
        <li>Stir noodles to prevent them sticking to each other or the pot</li>
        <li>Chop meat into medium chunks and add to the pan, seperating them from the mushrooms by creating a little empty quarter with oil</li>
        <li>Save the noodles when they are done, tipping them into a collinder and keeping seperate</li>
        <li>Stir the meat, trying to crisp up at least one side before mixing with the mushrooms</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to the meat and mushroom mix, using about a third of the sachet if you have one</li>
        <li>After 1 min, mix the meat and mushrooms into the veggie mix and add another third of the sachet of sauce</li>
        <li>Add the noodles to the mix, adding the rest of the sauce and adding a bit of water by cleaning out the sachet to get the rest of the sace out</li>
        <li>Mix and serve</li>
    </ol>
